# Tutorial GITHUB:

First of all, you have to clone the project in a directory of your choosing.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/pokerfce/UniversityWebsite.git
  ```

After that, for every modification you're going to do, addition you're going to add. Create a new branch of the project:
  ```
  ## for BRANCH_NAME, let's follow the same standards to avoid confusion: (backend/frontend)-(functionality_name)
  git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME 
  ```


After editing or adding your things:
  ```
  git add -A
  git commit -m "small description here"
  ```

Then, push the branch to github:
  ```
  git push -u origin BRANCH_NAME
  ```

At this point, you can find your branch in https://github.com/pokerfce/UniversityWebsite/branches

Maybe the main branch which is   ``` main ``` already changed while you are doing your modifications. It's better to use
  ```
  git pull origin main
  ```
This brings any changes that have been made in the main branch, and grap the changes to your branch to avoid merge conflicts.

After this, you have to create a new PULL request on your branch. https://github.com/pokerfce/UniversityWebsite/branches
Here, you can put some detailed information if needed and just validate it.

I'll check it out, verify it and confirm it.
