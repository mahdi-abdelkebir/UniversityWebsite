# Tutorial GITHUB:

First of all, you have to clone the project in a directory of your choosing.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/pokerfce/UniversityWebsite.git
  ```

After that, for every modification you're going to do, addition you're going to add. Create a new branch of the project:
  ```
  ## for BRANCH_NAME, let's follow the same standards to avoid confusion: (backend/frontend)-(functionality_name)
  git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME
  ```


After editing or adding your things:
  ```
  git add -A
  git commit -m "small description here"
  ```

Then, push the branch to github:
  ```
  git push -u origin BRANCH_NAME
  ```

At this point, you can find your branch in https://github.com/pokerfce/UniversityWebsite/branches

Maybe the main branch which is   ``` main ``` already changed while you are doing your modifications. It's better to use
  ```
  git pull origin main
  ```
This brings any changes that have been made in the main branch, and grap the changes to your branch to avoid merge conflicts.

After this, you have to create a new PULL request on your branch. https://github.com/pokerfce/UniversityWebsite/branches
Here, you can put some detailed information if needed and just validate it.

I'll check it out, verify it and confirm it.

After the branch is merged, it'll be deleted from github.


# HOW TO ADD EMAIL:

Go to ```C:\xampp\sendmail``` and open ```sendmail.ini  ```

Modify these parameters

  ```
smtp_server=smtp.gmail.com
smtp_port=587
smtp_ssl=tls
error_logfile=error.log
debug_logfile=debug.log
 ```

 During the repetitive testing, I discovered that GMAIL allows you to send only some few messages before banning you until the next day. Probably to prevent spamming. So I had to make multiple accounts, try them and check if they worked. All errors will be displayed in the  ``` error.log  ``` next to the ```sendemail.ini``` file.


 ```
auth_username=joe.localhost1@gmail.com
auth_password=jwssmhaexympwgpl
 ```
  ```
auth_username=joe.localhost2@gmail.com
auth_password=yfebrxnecjwpppli

  ```

I already taken care of the server-side code inside the Class ``` Emailer.php ```. Feel free to check it.

If this didn't work, please immediately DM me.
